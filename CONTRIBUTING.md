# Contributing

We happily invite any member of Bits of Good to contribute to our bot. Please read each of the following steps below to see how you can get started!

1. Open or assign yourself to an [Issue](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/bog-bot/issues).
2. Create a new branch with your first name, # of the Issue you assigned yourself to, and a [slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug). For example, if I were George, and I wanted to work on Issue #57 to add a new feature for email support, I would name my branch like so

```
george/57/email-support
```
3. Make a PR between your branch and `master` that links to the Issue you want to resolve.
4. Get at least one other contributor to review your PR and make comments when necessary.
5. Add yourself to the [Contributors](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/bog-bot#Contributors) list üòéÔ∏è

If you have any questions, just reach out to the current Director of Engineering for help. Happy contributing!
