# Contributing

We happily invite any member of Bits of Good to contribute to the bot. Please read each of the following steps below to see how you can get started!

1. Open or assign yourself to an Issue from our [Projects](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/bog-bot/projects) page.
2. Create a new branch named using the following format:
```
[your-first-name]/[issue-#]/[slug]
```

For example, if...
- my first name was `George`
- I assigned myself to Issue `#57`
- Issue #57 is titled `"Add email support"`

Then I would name my branch:
```
george/57/email-support
```

3. Make a PR between your branch and `master` that links to the Issue you want to resolve.
4. Get at least one other contributor to review your PR and make comments when necessary.
5. Merge your PR once it has been approved!
6. Add yourself to the [Contributors](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/bog-bot#Contributors) list üòéÔ∏è

If you have any questions, just reach out to the current Director of Engineering for help. Happy contributing!
