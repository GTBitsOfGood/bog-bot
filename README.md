# The Bits of Good Bot

Bits of Good members have a lot on their plates. Between school, BoG, and other activities, they are constantly swamped with work. To help them out, we've created a bot that helps automate the pain out of their BoG workflow. Features include...

- **General Meeting check-ins** for all 150+ members
- **[Donut Dates](https://www.donut.com/pairing/)** for BoGgers to get to know their BoG pals
- **Anonymous feedback** so important issues can be voiced
- And much more!
